With today's release the toolset of [runverter.io](https://runverter.io) can be called feature complete for now. The last - and my personal favourite - tool in line is the new split time calculator.

<img {...meta.images.screenrecording} />

The split time calculator is your little assistant to work out a proper race strategy and helps you to keep track of it. You can pick a race distance, your desired finishing time and whether you prefer to run an even pace throughout the entire race or change the speed during the race.

## Progress bar

<img {...meta.images.progress} />

For easier orientation, the splits are divided by a tiny little progressbar indicating how far you have come until this split.

## Print it!

The generated splits are very printer friendly. Print it out and tape it to the wristband of your GPS watch to recheck the times on the go. Play a little bit with the zoom in the printer dialog to make it fit to your needed size.
