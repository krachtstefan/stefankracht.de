## The only running calculator you will ever need

What pace do you need for a sub 4 hours marathon? What would your 10 km time be like when you manage to keep up the 4:15 pace from last weeks tempo training? How many kilometers does a 100 mile ultra marathon exactly have?

As a passionate runner you may have asked yourself one of these questions before. With [runverter.io](https://runverter.io) I want to give you a simple tool to help you answer all of them.

## Why runverter?

There are a lot of tools out there that calculate and convert running metrics back and forth. Some of them are pretty barebones, some of them are very complex. Some of them are easy to understand but hard to use, some are the other way around. And most of them look ugly.

There is such a big potential to get the most out of it. I wanted something good looking. Something easy to understand but yet as smart and feature rich as possible.

Enable this mode if you consider yourself an expert. It will hide all labels and descriptions to go for a very minimal appearance.

### Detailed decimal place

Every tool is using your most recent data, e.g. if you're using the pace calculator to calculate your marathon pace and switch to the pace converter your recently calculated marathon pace is already prefilled.

### Offline support
