I've just released Raceday.me live chat, which is the biggest new feature release since the app launched earlier this year.

If you haven't heard of it, raceday.me is a live tracking app for runners with a very special focus on race events like f.e. marathons. Check out the [demo](https://raceday.me/demo) to see it live in action.

The main goal of this project is to make running events more accessible for spectators and let them be a part of this very special day of the athlete.

## Okay, it's a chat. What's so innovative about that?

The app already offers a huge variety of technical data of the race. You can see the the last known and the asumed position on the map, detailed splits evaluation, target pace and even a predicted finishing time. Pretty much any information you could get out of the smartphone sensors of a running person. And currently this flow of information only goes to one direction. From the athlete to the viewer.

The new chat feature (which of course can be disabled by the athlete) takes this to another level. It allows every viewer to communicate with each other or even with the athlete itself before, during and after a race.

## use cases

To explain the idea behind it, let me give you an idea of various useful scenarios that I can image.

**spectators**

Let‘s start with the obvious ones. Spectators can communicate with each other. Cheer the athlete, post photos, some funny gifs or just congratulate the runner when the race is over.

The special fun starts when some spectators are on sight and share some exclusive information. That could be anything like wheather conditions, photos from the cheerzone or just their location to inform the athlete about where to expect a little motivational boost

Speaking of location, users near the race track, are allowed to optionally tag their message or photos with their current location which is a very handy feature. If it‘s a crewed race like an ultra marathon, race chat is a good place to keep everyone up to date, especially when the crew is spread over the course.

**the athlete can post updates**

The athlete might use the chat to post pictures before the race or inform the viewers with a short race recab from the finish area. Or remember an ultra race where the runner might need some supporting words during a walking pause. It‘s also pretty handy if something unexpected happens, like a DNF or an injury (post location!!)
