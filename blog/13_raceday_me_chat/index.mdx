I've just released Raceday.me live chat, which is the biggest new feature release since the app launched earlier this year.

If you haven't heard of it, raceday.me is a live tracking app for runners with a very special focus on race events like f.e. marathons. Check out the [demo](https://raceday.me/demo) to see it live in action.

The main goal of this project is to make running events more accessible for spectators and let them be a part of this very special day of the athlete.

## Okay, it's a chat. What's so innovative about that?

The app already offers a huge variety of technical data of the race. You can see the last known and the asumed position on the map, detailed splits evaluation, target pace and even a predicted finishing time. Pretty much any information you could get out of the smartphone sensors of a running person. And currently, this flow of information only goes in one direction. From the athlete to the viewer.

The new chat feature (which of course can be disabled by the athlete) takes this to another level. It allows every viewer to communicate with each other or even with the athlete itself before, during and after a race.

## use cases

To explain the thought behind it, let me give you an idea of various scenarios that I consider useful.

**spectators**

Let‚Äòs start with the obvious ones. Spectators can communicate with each other. Cheer the athlete, post photos, some funny gifs or just congratulate the runner when the race is over.

The big fun starts when some spectators are on sight and share some exclusive information to the other viewers. That could be anything like weather conditions, photos from the cheer zone or even their exact location to tell the athlete where to expect a little motivational boost from the sideline.

**race crew**

Speaking of location, users near the race track are allowed to tag their message or photos with their current location which is a very handy feature. If it‚Äòs a crewed race like an ultra marathon, race chat is a good place to keep everyone up to date, especially when the crew is spread over the course.

**the athlete**

The athlete might use the chat to post pictures before the race or inform the viewers with a short race recap from the finish area. Or remember an ultra race where the runner might need some supporting words during a walking pause or posts some updates from the aid station. It‚Äòs also pretty handy if something unexpected happens, like a DNF or an injury.
