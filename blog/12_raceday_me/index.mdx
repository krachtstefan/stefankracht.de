Quite some time ago I wrote about [how I would like to change race day live tracking on running events](racday-livetracking-for-runners) and make it more useable and accessible for spectators. It's been 16 months since this prototype and I have been so busy working on this that I never wrote about how it actually turned out.

I finally released [raceday.me](https://raceday.me) a couple of months ago and this is a little article about the key features of the app and who it all works.

## How do I use the app?

Let's say you are a runner and attempt to run a marathon and want to let your friends and family follow along at home or directly on site. Raceday.me got you covered.

<img {...meta.images.app} />

- Just sign up on the website and create a new race event by uploading the track (more on that later) and setting your personal time goal.
- Share the generated link with your friend, family, followers, trainer or even your dog. They can follow you along and don't even need to download any app to do so.
- Open the app just before the race and keep it running during the run to share your live progress with all the viewers. The app is designed to be very battery efficient. So don't worry about a draining battery.

The viewers can see the real time position on the map which is predicted by past location data and recalculated every 20 seconds when new live informations are available.

There a couple of other configurable widgets to monitor the athletes pace, progress and detailed splits. All designed to keep track of the athletes race goal.

## How does it work?

I have to admit that uploading the race track in forehand seems a bit of a downside and may scare off some people to use it. But many races provide a GPX file on their website and tools like [gpsies.com](https://www.gpsies.com) help to find the track of most common races.

Knowing the track allows to have very accurate calculations with very little updates from the athlete because when you know the track, you can make accurate assumptions on what happened between the datapoints. Even more, you can also make predictions on what may happen in the upcoming parts since the planned course is exactly known.

###INTERACTIVE WIDGET###

**This technology makes it possible to let the app work even with very little location updates from the athlete.** Which has a lot of benefits:

- Very accurate calculations and predictions
- Long battery life to suport usage even on 100 mile ultra races (example time)
- Handle bad gps conditions with automagic corrections based on the race track
- Internet outages on parts of the race are handled very well

## Pricing

Raceday.me is free to use for everyone. There are [options to support the development of the app](https://raceday.me/premium) but the goal is to make it always accessible for everyone. I hope to find a sponsor or may sell licences to race directors in the future to cover the development costs.
