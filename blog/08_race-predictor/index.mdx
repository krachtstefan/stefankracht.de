In the last couple of weeks I've been busy to improve the toolset of runverter.io. Here is an overview of the changes from the latest update.

## New Tool: race predictor

The race predictor uses a previous race result to estimate an upcomming one. It is based on the peter [riegel method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Riegel) which is suitable for runs between 3.5 minutes and 3 hours, 50 minutes. Other race prediction algorithms may be added in the future. I'm also planing to offer the possibility to provide a second reference run to make the fatigue coefficient variable.
