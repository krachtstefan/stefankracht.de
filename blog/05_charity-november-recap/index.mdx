Last month was very exciting. I decided to [donate all of november's Stickerlicious income](give-something-back) and the feedback was overwhelming. I received lots of great feedback and many people startet to share this campaign.

I'm really proud to call the last 30 days the most successful month since I launched this project. I was able to sell 4 times as much stickers as usual. 68 MacBook stickers made **544 €** which I just forwarded to [children’s hospice Sternenbrücke](https://sternenbruecke.de/home) a minute ago.

Thanks to everyone who helped and participated the last month. It wouldn't have been possible without you <3

Merry Xmas
