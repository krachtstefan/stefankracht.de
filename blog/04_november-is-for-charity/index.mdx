This november will be a special month for Stickerlicious. 100% of november’s income will be donated to children’s hospice Sternbrücke in Hamburg.

Children’s hospice Sternenbrücke is an institution for children and young people with incurable or degenerative diseases with no possibilities for curative therapies and a limited life expectancy. It's a place to support patients and families on their hard journey as fully and comfortably as possible.

Every sold sticker will help raising money and you can be a part of it. Buy a sticker and/or share this post to spread the world <3
