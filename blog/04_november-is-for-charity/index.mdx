This november will be a special month for Stickerlicious. 100% of november’s income will be donated to children’s hospice Sternbrücke in Hamburg.

[Children’s hospice Sternenbrücke](https://sternenbruecke.de/home) is an institution for children and young people with incurable or degenerative diseases with no possibilities for curative therapies and a limited life expectancy. It's a place to support patients and families on their hard journey as fully and comfortably as possible.

Every sold sticker will help raising money and you can be a part of it. [Buy a sticker](http://stickerlicio.us/) and/or [share this post](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%20http%3A%2F%2Fstefankracht.de%2Fnews%2Fgive-something-back%20%23stickerlicious) to spread the word <3
